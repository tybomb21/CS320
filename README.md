How is software automation improving efficiency?
-With automated testing, it frees up developers time therefore saves time and money.  The saved time can be focused elsewhere to get more done and be more efficient.

How is it changing the field of software development?
-Its changing the field of SD becasue its makeing developers/testers learn new skills, speeinging up testing processes, and saving companies time and money during projects.

What implications does it have for quality engineers?
-Quality engineers will not solely rely on automated tewsting, but use it to comlpimen their own manual testing practices. I do think that the overall implication is that qualuty engineers will no longer be needed, but i think this is a wrongful assumption.

What are the pros and cons of software automation?
-Some pros are saving time and money, testing more lines of code at a faster rate, and freeing up developers so they can use their focus somewhere else on the project.
Some of the cons are that automated tests are not as thorough as manual tests, although faster, they will not catch human error as easily as a human will.
